Back-End Development
About This Repository
This repository is part of my ongoing journey to transition into the world of software engineering, with a keen interest in becoming proficient in back-end development, IT, and cybersecurity. Here, I document my progress, host my projects, and gather the collective knowledge acquired along my educational path.

Who I Am
I'm a lifelong learner, currently 58, with a rich background that spans 22 years in electronic manufacturing and 17 years in government service. My previous careers, while rewarding, were quite distinct from the tech industry, which is exactly why I've chosen this new path: to embrace change and not simply continue more of the same. Thanks to a stable pension and a flexible current job, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to dedicate time to studying and developing new skills in this field.

Purpose of This Repository
Showcase Progress: This repository serves as a living record of my coursework, assignments, and personal projects.
Facilitate Learning: While primarily for my own use, I hope it can serve as a resource—or a cautionary tale—for others who are on a similar path. My code and documentation are as much a part of my learning process as they are teaching tools. Use with caution.
Encourage Collaboration: I welcome feedback, advice, and collaboration from fellow learners and seasoned professionals alike. Let’s learn from each other!
Goals
My ultimate aim is to acquire the skills necessary to function effectively as a software engineer within a small company, specialize in IT, or delve into the cybersecurity sector.

How You Can Help
If you have any suggestions, feedback on my code, or guidance on best practices, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your input is invaluable and greatly appreciated!

Final Words
Thank you for visiting my repository. Whether you find something useful for your own projects or notice something that could be improved, I hope you'll share your thoughts. Have a fantastic journey in your own pursuits, and let's grow together in this exciting field!
